        <p>Work began on Vim in 1988, but the heritage of this editor traces back all the way to the dawn of computers. It was an expansion on the ideas of Stevie, which in turn was based directly upon Vi. Vim is today known as standing for Vi IMproved, although at its release it was said to mean Vi IMitation. Vi was a shortening of visual, because it was a version of ex written to take advantage of this newfangled thing called "screens". I'm not joking. ex itself stands for extended, as it is an extended version of ed, one of the very first text editing programs ever. ed's name comes from "edit".</p>
        <p>Since 1988, Vim has come a long way. It was first released publicly in 1991 and has since been updated. The code began stagnating at one point, and a fork called neovim was introduced. Neovim had all the features Vim refused to implement, such as async. This forced Vim to create update 8.0, which introduced a lot of the features neovim had. Today, Vim and Neovim are in many ways similar, although Neovim continues to provide more fuctionality than Vim.</p>
